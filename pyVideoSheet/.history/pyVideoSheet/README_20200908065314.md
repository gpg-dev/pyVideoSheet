# pyVideoSheet

Python video thumbnail contact sheet creator.

pyVideoSheet is designed for efficiency and simplicity, allowing users to create video contact sheets rapidly.
pyVideoSheet can be used as a standalone command-line application and as an importable package.

## Dependencies

pyVideoSheet requires the following softwares and packages to work:

* Python (Of course! pyVideoSheet is written in Python 2.7 though)
* Python Image Library (PIL)
* FFmpeg

### Basic instruction on how to install dependencies

#### Python

Because pyVideoSheet is written in Python, therefore there must be a valid Python installed to use pyVideoSheet.

Python package for any platform can be downloaded from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

#### Python Image Library (PIL)

There are many ways to install PIL, but here we would recommend to use [Pillow](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/3.0.0), a nice and easy folk of PIL.
To install Pillow, run this command

```bash
> easy_install Pillow
```

More details instruction on how to install Pillow can be found in Pillow's [documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/index.html).

#### FFmpeg

FFmpeg is a cross-platform media solution that pyVideoSheet uses as the primary way to interact with a video.
pyVideoSheet requires a working FFmpeg to work.

You can get the latest FFmpeg from its website https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html . 
Because compiling FFmpeg properly is quite tricky, we'd recommend you to stick to the pre-built packages unless you really need otherwise.

Please note that FFmpeg must be included in the system search path for pyVideoSheet to work correctly.
You can test this by running

```bash
> ffmpeg -h
```

If you can see FFmpeg's help, it should work alright. Otherwise please check how to add FFmpeg to search path in its [documentations](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)

## Installing pyVideoSheet

1. Get the latest version of pyVideoSheet.
   This can be done by either using git:

   ```bash
   > git clone https://github.com/rorasa/pyVideoSheet.git
   ```

   or by downloading the zip archive <https://github.com/rorasa/pyVideoSheet/archive/master.zip> and extract it.

2. Go into the downloaded directory

   ```bash
   >   cd pyVideoSheet-<version>
   ```

3. Install the package

   ```bash
   > python setup.py install
   ```

## Using pyVideoSheet as a standalone application

pyVideoSheet can be used as a command-line application. This provides a quick and easy way to create contact sheets.
The best thing about being a command-line application, as opposed to a GUI one, is the ease of writing a batch script for it, especially when one has to work with lots of videos. 

Let's see how to create a contact sheet for a video.
In this readme we're going to make contact sheets for this lovely creative common film [**Big Buck Bunny**](https://peach.blender.org/) by [Peach project](https://peach.blender.org/).
To make a contact sheet, run this command

```bash
> python -m pyVideoSheet.create Big_Buck_Bunny_1080p.avi
```

and you should get this result:
![example sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rorasa/pyVideoSheet/master/examples/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080p.png)
This executes *create* utility of pyVideoSheet to create a contact sheet with the same name as our video using default options.
Customisation options can be added using optional flags.

There are many customisation options, as follows:

Options | Example | Description
--------|---------|-------------
-h, --help | --help | Display pyVideoSheet's instruction on command-line
-o, --output | -o out.png | Specify contact sheet's filename
-n, --number | -n 30 | Specify total number of thumbnails. Each thumbnail is at equidistant apart. The default option is -n 20. This option cannot be use with --interval.
-i, --interval | -i 300 | Specify fixed interval between each thumbnails. Total number of thumbnail is vary. This option cannot be use with --number.
-c, --column | -c 6 | Specify number of column of the thumbnail grid. The default is -c 5.
--notime | --notime | Remove thumbnail's timestamp.
--header | --header 120 | Specify the height of description header in pixels. The default is 100.
-t, --thumbsize | -t 300 250 | Specify the maximum size of thumbnail. Thumbnails will retain its aspect ratio. The default is -t 220 220.
--textcolour | --textcolour 255 255 0 0 | Specify description's text colour in RGBA format.
--bgcolour | --bgcolour 255 255 0 0 | Specify description's text colour in RGBA format.
--font | --font font-file.ttf 12 | Specify description's font and font size. Support any TrueType font.
--preview | --preview | Preview the contact sheet on default image viewer.

## Using pyVideoSheet as a package

pyVideoSheet can be imported into any Python project, allowing a quick and flexible way to create a video contact sheet programatically.

### Examples

First example shows how to create a simple contact sheet for *Big_Buck_Bunny_1080p.avi*

```python
import pyVideoSheet as pvs

vid = pvs.Video("Big_Buck_Bunny_1080p.avi")
vsheet = pvs.Sheet(vid)
vsheet.makeSheetByNumber(20)
vsheet.sheet.save("code_example.png")
```

This results in a default contact sheet. 
![code example png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rorasa/pyVideoSheet/master/examples/code_example.png)

The next example shows the full customisation capability of pyVideoSheet.

```python
import pyVideoSheet as pvs

vid = pvs.Video("Big_Buck_Bunny_1080p.avi") # create Video object
vidLength = vid.getVideoDuration() # get video duration in seconds

# create a 5x6 grid contact sheet with blue text without timestamp
vsheet1 = pvs.Sheet(vid) # create Sheet object
vsheet1.setProperty('gridColumn',6) # set 6 columns
vsheet1.setProperty('textColour',(0,0,255,0)) # set text to blue
vsheet1.setProperty('timestamp',False) # disable timestamp

sheet_1 = vsheet1.makeSheetByNumber(30) # create contact sheet of 5 times 6 columns
sheet_1.save('grid_example.png') # save with PIL save()

vsheet1.sheet.show() # preview with PIL show(). The created sheet is kept as Sheet.sheet variable.

# create a single row preview with black text on white background
vsheet2 = pvs.Sheet(vid) # create Sheet object
vsheet2.setProperty('gridColumn',1) # set 1 columns
vsheet2.setProperty('textColour',(0,0,0,0)) # set text to black
vsheet2.setProperty('backgroundColour',(255,255,255,0)) # set background to white
vsheet2.setProperty('maxThumbSize',(500,500)) # allow larger thumbnails

sheet_2 = vsheet2.makeSheetByInterval(600) # create one thumbnail every 10 minutes
sheet_2.show()

vsheet2.sheet.save('column_example.png') # save with PIL save()
```

This is our sheet_1 "grid_example.png"

And this is our sheet_2 "column_example.png"

* **Parameter**: **interval**—a time in seconds.
* **Return**: A PIL Image object.

**makeSheetByNumber(*number*)**

Create a contact sheet. The total number of thumbnails is fixed.
Each thumbnail is created at the interval defined by the video duration divided by *number*.

* **Parameter**: **number**—a number of thumbnails.
* **Return**: A PIL Image object.

## Supported formats

pyVideoSheet works based upon PIL and FFmpeg, thus the supporting formats are set by these dependencies.
Most commonly used video formats (such as mp4, avi, mov *etc.*) should work with FFmpeg, thus should work with pyVideoSheet.
Most encoding should be supported as well (including MPEG-2, Xvid, h264). 
For more information on FFmpeg supported formats, please check [FFmpeg documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html)
Most image formats (including JPEG and PNG) should also work as an output format.
